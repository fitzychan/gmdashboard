If your not a developer and just want to use the app... Just click the "Clone or Download" button and download the zip.  Once you have it unpacked. go the following folder structure and run the .exe
".\gmdashboard-development\GmDashboard\bin\Release"

If ya have questions.  Post it in the issues so i can take the questions and put it in the readme.
