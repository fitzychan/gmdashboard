1. Start up GETEA in Kube - DONE
2. Get file and folder setup to look like a tree.  So we can have folders and sub folders.
3. figure out how to get calls to GITEA with no user.  This is the READ from place first. - DONE
4. figure out how to push to GITEA 
5. figure out how to have multiple repos in the editor at a time.  This will allow people to not have to make mega repos.
6. fix the subroll mapping in the the ChartEditor...
7. build a login integraded in to AD so the same user can automatically exist for GITEA and the client.
8. Do some leg work and upload charts from reddit into the gitea site.  
9. DO A BETA!

Fukkin...  After all that the thick client should be DONE...  For awhile...


specifics for GITEA...Talk to and potentially pay Chris Ducharm for help on this?
1. reskin it to look like something new!
2. Do some customizations to potentially simplify the workflow.  Depends on user feed back.
3. Add a "Feed" tab where it will act kinda like reddit where it shows new things coming in.
4. Add a Org of GmDashboard.  This is something that would be nice because its like "sancitioned" charts.  So it feels more official.
5. finish building the OneShotRPG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Fuck yea.  Maybe hire/pay toast?
6. This is a maybe thing...  Create a scraper that scrapes "/r/BehindTheTables" for charts people are putting there.  Then put those in there own Org and call it "BehindTheTables"

Specifics for finializing this as a biz thing...  
1. Create a website/forum to link to all the things.  I would also like to post tutorial videos on this.  Create a subscription model?
2. Paetron?
3. Kickstarter?
4. Book some booths at some local cons?



After we get some regular users...Try to build it as a cloud product?
1. Create a facade API so we can hide the GITEA api...  We are going to build this with the idea of SAAS
2. See if we cant get users?  Figure out how to charge people for this?
3. Try to sell it to the BIG BOYEEEEs
